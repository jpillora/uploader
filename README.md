2015/06/24 01:10:59 #0001 received 53B
```

### CLI Usage

```
  Usage: uploader [options]

  note: udp creates files using a stream of packets. udp packets are not authenticated,
  so it's highly recommended that you set an allowed-ip range to prevent misuse.
  udp packets are all appended to a file called 'md5(<src-ip>:<src-port>).bin'.
  udp streams are considered closed after --udp-close and the file will be closed.

  Options:
  --dir, -d         output directory (defaults to tmp)
  --overwrite, -o   duplicates are overwritten (auto-renames files by default)
  --auth, -a        require basic auth 'username:password' on http connections
  --port, -p        tcp listening port (default 3000)
  --udp-port, -u    udp listening port (default disabled)
  --udp-close       close udp file after timeout (default 2s)
  --no-log, -n      disable http request logging
  --allowed-ip, -i  allowed ip range (allows multiple)
  --verbose, -v     enable verbose logging
  --version         display version
  --help, -h        display help

  Version:
    0.0.0
